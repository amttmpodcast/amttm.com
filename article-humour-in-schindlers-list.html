            <p class="artikel-datum">29 July 2025</p>
            <p>In 1993, the world was introduced to a truly great film. When <em>Schindler’s List</em> was released, it was quickly lauded worldwide for every characteristic a movie can have, all while exploring one of the most provocative events of modern history. The Holocaust is perhaps the most sensitive topic one can explore in Western society, making its choice for any plot a difficult one. Any creator wishing to centre a story around such subject matter will always run into an issue of balance – while not enough sensitivity will be seen as heartless, too much focus on the negative aspects of the topic could make the audience uncomfortable, thereby making the story unenjoyable. This is only doubly true with the Holocaust. Yet, this balance is achieved in <em>Schindler’s List</em> with such incredible grace that it almost seems impossible. Perhaps it is of little surprise then that this film comes from Spielberg, the director of magical stories.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

        <div>
            It is without a doubt Spielberg is known for his films of balanced plots filled with colourful, humorous characters. Take Ian Malcolm in <em>Jurassic Park</em>, the sleazy mathematician acted by Jeff Goldblum, or the humorous attitude of Indiana Jones, like when he unceremoniously shoots the scimitar-flourishing mini boss in <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em> (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/indianajones/comments/15b45r7/harrison_ford_got_sick_during_the_filming_of_the/">though this wasn't the original intention</a>). In these films, the humour can add depth to fictional characters and build contrast, so the serious parts feel more earnest. The use of humour in films isn’t restricted to happy movies like these either. Tarantino is a prime example of a director who employs a heavy use of dark humour, where the audience will laugh at ostensibly horrible things. It can also serve a purpose within the plot, such as building cohesion between characters as is typically seen in war movies, such as the banter between Schofield and Blake in <em>1917</em>. 
        </div>
        <div>
            Yet, there are some things humour cannot mix with to such an extent that it is taboo. The Holocaust is one of those things. Thus, I probably shouldn’t have been too surprised by the reactions of disbelief I received from the few people I mentioned the idea of this article to. So before I delve into this any further, I’d like to make a point very clear &mdash; I’m not suggesting for a moment that <em>Schindler's List</em> is a funny movie, in the same way that we would agree that <em>Jurassic Park</em> is not a comedy. While there are some instances of deliberate comedy in it that may evoke laughter, I’m largely focusing on its use of humour, both from our perspective as the audience and from those of the characters.
        </div>
        <div>
            So… what is humour? In older English, it would not have been uncommon to say one was “in good humour” to express a generally good mood. If we go <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy_of_humours?utm_source=chatgpt.com"> back to the Elizabethan Era </a>, humour refers to the dominating trait of a character in a story, almost like the driving force of an archetype, originating from humorism, the theory that a few fundamental fluids (<em>humor</em> being the Latin translation of fluid) within our bodies were responsible for one’s behaviour and emotions. While our minds may turn towards ideas related to “being funny”, perhaps the etymology of the word humour lends more to ideas of “being happy”.
        </div>
        <div>
            I don’t want to get stuck in a tangent about the exact definition of humour. It’ll suffice to say that humour within storytelling is something that amuses or tries to amuse the observing audience or the characters of the story by evoking a smile, or alluding to something that would evoke a smile. I guess the next logical question we should ask ourselves is: how does humour exhibit itself? We could start by looking at whether it’s a product of our unique, human experience, but I was surprised to learn that some <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240223-do-animals-have-sense-of-humour">animals, arguably, might experience humour as well</a>. Granted, animal-related humour would be basic in nature and it seems most relatable to slapstick humour. Apes can be observed poking each other for seemingly no reason other than to have fun, akin to a young child. This sort of humour is perhaps the most widely understood as it relies little on language or culture, requiring no verbal communication but rather just a low level of empathy to understand the reactions of the subjects.
        </div>
        <div>
            As we add in self-awareness and speech, humour can quickly manifest itself very complexly. Wordplay is one example of humour that requires understanding of language, which automatically limits its understanding to those who speak the language being used. A good example of this I like is from Rammstein’s most famous song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3q8Od5qJio"><em>Du Hast</em></a>. Due to the fact that German verbs tend to appear at the end of sentences, the lyrics deliberately leave off the final word for some time, with only the first three words <em>du hast/hasst mich</em> being sung, which could be interpreted as either “you have me”, “you hate me” or as a sentence yet to be completed in the German perfect past tense. Thus, it’s fitting when the sentence completes to “you asked me” (<em>du hast mich gefragt</em>) followed by an aggressive <em>Nein!</em> to wedding vows being sung.
        </div>
        <div>
            Perhaps one of the most complex forms of humour is irony, depending heavily on language, culture and nuance, and ironically itself eludes a strict definition. Irony captivates me; it’s a household term, yet how many of us actually know what it is? Apparently the strict definition is contended, but in general, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irony">it is always any thing or situation that involves juxtaposing or contradicting ideas</a>. As we delve further into irony, we run into a myriad of sub-definitions. Verbal irony is one of the simpler forms, when one says something without meaning its semantic definition. My favourite example of this is the rhetorical question “does the Pope shit in his hat?”, most known to me from Hank in <em>Breaking Bad</em> (S1E4), who uses the phrase to indicate the obvious answer of “yes” when asked if he wants another beer. I love this use of irony (and have had a great deal of fun explaining it to non-English speakers) because it’s a combination of two obvious “yes” questions to create a contradictorily obvious “no” question that yet still means “yes”. At some point of time, someone <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/7xo7mm/the_expression_does_the_pope_shit_in_his_hat_is/someone"> decided to take the already ironic rhetorical questions </a> to make it even more ironic. That fascinates me.
        </div>
        <div>
            More complex forms of irony, such as dramatic irony or cosmic irony, branch away from mere statements, instead involving greater situations within storytelling. The beauty of storytelling is the creation of a universe that is self-contained and unaware of our own, and the characters within are at the whim of the writers. Irony can quickly arise from the contradiction between the characters’ own subjective experiences and what we know about what's going on in their universe as the audience. I can’t resist but cite <em>Breaking Bad</em> here again. There is a great use of irony in the infamous episode <em>Fly</em> (S3E8), when Walt deeply contemplates the cosmic impossibility of randomly meeting Jane’s dad the night she died before his eyes. The irony almost seems to be that Walt, whose scientific brain cannot comprehend ideas of fate, really is experiencing fate, for he is part of the fabricated story the writers of <em>Breaking Bad</em> created. Walt really is a character within a fiction and his ruminations hint at some sort of recognition of a grand design as though he’s on the cusp of breaking through the fourth wall… and he is right. 
        </div>
        <div>
            Granted, this sort of irony is less humorous and I’m digressing into a <em>Breaking Bad</em> analysis, which can easily happen. It’s worth acknowledging the close relationship between irony and humour which exists because both hinge on that moment when you realise what it means, like “getting” a joke. Whether it’s simply funny or actually intriguing, it engages and entertains the viewer, <a href="https://amttm.com/article-what-is-film">which is arguably the fundamental purpose of film</a>. So how does this come into <em>Schindler’s List</em>? The answer to this isn’t straightforward, as it has a very layered use of humour. To try simplify this, I’ve broken the humour down into two layers. The first is <em><strong>diegetic</strong></em> versus <em><strong>non-diegetic</strong></em>, the former being humour used and recognised by the characters within the story and the latter being humour only recognisable by us. Then, a second layer breaks up each of these into <em><strong>ironic</strong></em> versus <em><strong>non-ironic</strong></em>. The non-ironic humour tends to be more easily identifiable and less dividing, while a lot of the ironic humour I’ve identified isn’t really humorous at all and more likely to cause contention. I caveat this by saying that humour is very subjective, so I’ve taken a loose definition of humour to include anything that could be interpreted as humorous if the subject matter or settings were changed. The fact that this movie is about the Holocaust means people won't feel the motivation at all to even consider anything humorous within it, and some have argued to me that there is no use of humour in <em>Schindler’s List</em> at all. I beg to differ. If you are in this camp, I’d urge you to watch the movie again and observe the uses of humour throughout it. Perhaps you’ll change your mind.
        </div>
        <div>
            Below, I’ve roughly plotted the use of humour along the movie’s timeline based on these four categories. A lot of the less controversial, non-diegetic and non-ironic humour is used in the first third of the movie before our primary villain Amon Göth is introduced. Up until this point, there is very little killing (the one-armed worker, the first victim, is killed just before Göth is introduced) as the plot centres on the introduction of Oskar Schindler. Just like Schindler who is very sanguine about his profiteering prospects in defeated Poland, the movie maintains a positive tone. No time is wasted on Schindler’s motivations. In the first act, we’re pushed along scene after scene by John Williams’ marching harp and woodwinds to learn that Schindler is a man of money, nothing else, only regarding the terrible political and social situation as a means to profit. In reciprocation, the Jews play the game with him, and are also ebullient in doing so. They take their predicament on the chin, willing to work with Schindler to make money where they can, such as when the black market group is congregating in the church, or when the Jewish investors decide to finance Schindler’s operation. Both scenes contain their little, humorous quips. Itzhak Stern, the stoic accountant, is the only one who seems to not be swayed by prospects of money, always serious and unsmiling with Schindler, never accepting a drink from him, as he is the only one focused from the very beginning on saving lives.

        <figcaption>Things get serious when data is involved. This is a visual showing the occurrences of humour in <em>Schindler's List</em>. Most of the humour is ironic, but some non-ironic humour exists, a lot of it targeting us, the audience, in the earlier parts of the movie. I'd be curious actually to see if anyone could match the exact bits with the timestamps in this image.</figcaption>

        <div>
            Schindler also plays the game with the SS. From our very first scene with him in the restaurant, we’re introduced to his immense charisma as he literally steals the room, having everyone laughing around him by the end of the night. He understands the core thing to eliciting cooperation: lifting the spirits. Whomever he’s dealing with, he maintains a jovial attitude and is full of good humour. Yet, it’s all a façade; his wife is the only person that knows what he’s really like. When she joins him briefly, we gain insight into his many previously failed business ventures as well as his crumbling marriage. Schindler’s obsession with the game is personally ruining him; his profiteering mindset comes with an emphatic indifference which is exactly what Stern sees. Schindler and even the other Jews do not or refuse to see what is really happening; an illusion is maintained through humour and it convinces us as the audience too. This creates the emotional high in the movie before things change for the worse when Göth enters the story.
        </div>

        <div>
            Before I get into Göth though, there is an interesting miniature foil to Schindler within this earlier act, especially in relation to humour. While Schindler uses humour to please people and curry favour with the SS, Nussbaum, a Jew who’s forced out of his upmarket apartment to be occupied by Schindler, uses humour in an alternate way, almost being portrayed as some sort of comic relief, possessing an almost slapstick attitude toward his predicament. When they arrive in their empty, derelict room in the ghetto, his wife tells him that “it could be worse”, to which he overwroughtly responds “what could possibly be worse?” At that moment, five other Jews walk into the room, all repeating <em>dzien dobry</em> (“good morning”) one after the other, almost like a skit. This use of humour, highlighting a relatively trivial event in relation to the rest of the movie, works to build up the gradually worsening situation of the Holocaust. Nussbaum, who is already distressed over being evicted from his home, has no idea what’s to follow in the next few years. Nor would we had we not had the hindsight of history.
        </div>
        <div>
            The foil exposes itself further when Nussbaum makes the following joke in the ghetto:
            
            <blockquote>
            <p>
                Nussbaum: <em>I had a dream I was broke and lived with 12 people I didn’t know. Then I woke and was broke and lived with 12 people I didn’t know!</em><br>
                Mrs. Nussbaum: <em>Do you have to laugh?</em><br>
                Nussbaum: <em>I have to!</em>
            </p>
            </blockquote>
            
            Like Schindler, Nussbaum uses humour within the story to the amusement of others, only in his case, it’s used more as a coping mechanism. This particular joke is a good example of the diegetic uses of humour. While the <em>dzien dobry</em> joke before was non-diegetic and potentially funny to us, this diegetic joke is potentially funny to the characters instead. To us though, it’s less funny as the darker notes of the story begin to settle in.
        </div>
        <div class="inline-image-block">
        <img src="onewebmedia/articles/schindler-nussbaum.jpg" alt="Nussbaum">
        <figcaption>Nussbaum might have been comic relief in another sort of film but his humour still plays an important role in contrasting the various stages of the Holocaust.</figcaption>
        </div>
        <div>
            Of course, the primary foil of Schindler is Göth, the infamous camp commandant, whose introduction signifies a massive tonal change within the film when the use of non-diegetic and non-ironic humour mostly vanishes. Yet, the use of ironic humour still remains because a lot of it is carried through Göth himself. Take his first scene when he is choosing a housemaid for himself. He tells them not to get too close to him as he doesn’t want to give them his cold. Only moments later, he has an engineer shot for contesting the quality of the camp accommodation being built; however, he still adopts her advice after she is killed. What are we to make of Göth from this? He is civil, cold-hearted and dutiful in the same moment. It is the sort of bureaucratic barbarism that uniquely defines the Nazi regime (<a href="https://amttm.com/schindlers-list">as we touched on in our podcast</a>), which itself possesses some sort of irony. The whole nature of the Holocaust was ludicrous; the annihilation of a certain people through bureaucracy has an unparalleled pointlessness to it. Yet, Göth is still a human and so the addition of his love interest in Helen Hirsch, his Jewish housemaid, creates that bizarre inner conflict between his emotions and his dogma. Perhaps this is indicative of the ultimate fate of social systems based on extremist ideologies &mdash; they always fall apart. 
        </div>
        <div>
            The dynamic between Schindler and Göth is compelling and humour plays a massive role in it; they seem to spend more time laughing with each other than anything else. They both follow similar journeys, beginning with a lack of empathy toward the Jews but with very different motivations. While Schindler plays the charismatic businessman to make his money, Göth plays the brutal camp commandant to ensure the Holocaust is carried out. It is no coincidence that Schindler begins to develop empathy toward his Jewish workers after the two meet. He saves the first Jews, Jakob and Chana Perlman, after Stern points out that Göth had recently killed 25 people after a prisoner tried to escape. Stern plays a shrewd game, trying over the course of the movie to stoke the embers of Schindler’s empathy. In this scene, he gets through to him largely because Göth behaves as a counterweight. Once this activism within Schindler is born, he continues using his joviality but now to save rather than to profit.
        </div>
        <div>
            The notorious train dousing scene highlights this well. In the middle of a sweltering day, the SS officers await the dispatchment of hundreds of Jews suffering in the train carts in front of them, not acknowledging their screams for water but instead grumbling about how hot and boring it is. In comes Schindler: “what do you say we get your fire hoses out here and hose down the cars?” he says. What ensues is an immense use of ironic humour: Göth complies and to him and the SS, it seems to be a form of entertainment to see the cars being hosed down by Schindler. Why? “This is really cruel, Oskar, you’re giving them hope” is what Göth says. Can he not comprehend that maybe Schindler is doing this to help the Jews? Does he really think Schindler is doing this to be more cruel? Or does he know what Schindler is really trying to do, knowing full well that these Jews will die anyway and laughing at Schindler who thinks he can save them? This diegetic use of humour is sick but also engaging because it’s hard to tell what’s exactly going on. It’s scenes like these which make <em>Schindler’s List</em> a timeless movie.
        </div>
        <div>
            This brings me onto one of the most well-known scenes of <em>Schindler’s List</em> &mdash; the pistol scene. I have always been intrigued by it ever since I watched this film many years ago. It’s when Menasha Lewartov, one of the Schindler Jews, is taken by Göth to be executed for not building door hinges fast enough. By this point in the movie, our natural expectation is that Lewartov will be killed by Göth but it doesn’t happen because the pistol jams, not just failing to fire on the first attempt, but every attempt after that. Even the second pistol Göth uses fails to fire, who grows frustrated, clobbering Lewartov but leaving him nonetheless alive. 
        </div>
        <div>
            This is a use of non-diegetic, ironic humour that could potentially be viewed as a comedy if the subject matter were different. The silly attitude of the SS, the ridiculousness of the jamming pistols and Göth’s tantrum almost reminds me of Wile E. Coyote’s plans to kill Road Runner being thwarted by nothing more than bad luck. The terrifying aspect of this scene in <em>Schindler’s List</em> though is that Göth could have easily finished the job if he wanted to. It was only his mood that led to Lewartov surviving. This arbitrariness of Göth’s decisions to kill or not to kill (another example is when he does not spare the boy who couldn’t clean his bathtub, despite Schindler’s attempts to convert him) is truly terrifying and represents the nature of the Holocaust, and generally genocide, well. It was luck that allowed those internees of the concentration camps to survive. It was luck for those that were saved by Schindler. The film often focuses on this idea. The pistol scene is thematically reused later in the film but much more menacingly when the women are accidentally sent to Auschwitz. This time, the tone is dire. We are introduced to the final killing mechanism of the Holocaust. It is immense and more terrifying than Göth with a gun because it is soulless, with no barrier of humanity to sway any decision. And yet, they survive because of luck. As they walk out of the chambers though, the women see a line of victims over the fence, being herded into the basement of a small brick building adorned with a chimney billowing black smoke. The guards around them are almost smiling, beckoning them to go in. These are not the lucky few. 
        </div>
        <div>
            At the end of the movie, you learn that the number of Schindler Jews and their descendants is greater at the movie’s release than the number of Jews that were left alive in the entirety of Poland, a horrifying fact. Schindler tangibly feels this at the end of the film during his poignant “I could have saved more” speech. The number killed in the Holocaust is incomprehensible and perhaps there is some irony within the fact that Schindler had saved only a drop in an ocean of blood. Yet, the Schindler Jews and the movie emphasise the immense importance of Schindler’s act because it is the symbol that matters.
        </div>
        <div>
            <em>Schindler’s List</em> will always be a fascinating movie to me and a lot of it is indeed carried by its use of humour. Even though Spielberg is walking on a tightrope by exploring such humour in the context of the Holocaust, he walks straight across without a single stumble, even adding in a few little hops and jumps along the way. It amazes me how balanced this movie is, yet intriguing in its unusual ways of exploring tales of tragedy. Yet, we must not forget that <em>Schindler’s List</em> is not just a tale of tragedy. It is also a beautiful tale of hope and redemption, telling us that even in the darkest of times, humanity will always prevail, and with it, our inextricable senses of humour. ※
